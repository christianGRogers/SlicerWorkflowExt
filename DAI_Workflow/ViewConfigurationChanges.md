# View Configuration Changes for Workflow

## Overview

Added automatic view layout switching to enhance the workflow experience:

1. **Before Cropping**: Three-up view (Red, Green, Yellow) for complete volume visualization
2. **After Cropping**: 3D-only view for focused 3D analysis

## Implementation Details

### New Functions Added

#### `set_three_up_view()`
- **Purpose**: Sets Slicer to display three slice views side by side (Red, Green, Yellow)
- **Views**: Axial, Sagittal, Coronal orientations - **3D view hidden**
- **Layout**: Custom horizontal layout with all three slice views visible
- **When Used**: Called at the start of volume cropping workflow
- **Features**: 
  - Uses custom layout ID 55902 (three slice views side by side)
  - **No 3D view** - focuses on slice-based volume review
  - Automatically assigns current volume to all views
- **Field of View Reset**: Images automatically centered using Slicer's built-in `resetSliceViews()` functionality
- Fits slices to show full volume extent with optimal centering#### `reset_slice_views_field_of_view()`
- **Purpose**: Utility function to reset and center all slice views
- **Implementation**: Uses Slicer's built-in `resetSliceViews()` functionality
- **When Used**: Can be called anytime to re-center slice views
- **Features**:
  - Leverages existing Slicer "Reset field of view" button functionality
  - Centers images in all active slice views optimally
  - Simple and reliable using proven Slicer methods
  - Useful for re-centering if views become misaligned

#### `set_3d_only_view()`
- **Purpose**: Switches to 3D-only visualization
- **When Used**: Called after cropping is completed
- **Features**:
  - Uses standard Slicer layout ID 4 (3D only view)
  - Ensures cropped volume is visible in 3D
  - Resets 3D camera for optimal viewing
  - Provides focused environment for lesion analysis

### Workflow Integration

#### **Critical Timing for resetSliceViews():**
The `slicer.util.resetSliceViews()` function must be called **after** volumes are loaded into the slice views for it to be effective:

```python
# 1. Assign volumes to all three views
for name in ("Red", "Green", "Yellow"):
    comp.SetBackgroundVolumeID(vol.GetID())
    logic.FitSliceToAll()

# 2. Process events to ensure volumes are fully loaded
slicer.app.processEvents()

# 3. Now call resetSliceViews - timing is critical!
slicer.util.resetSliceViews()
```

#### Before Cropping (`start_with_volume_crop`)
```python
def start_with_volume_crop():
    # Set 3D view background to black
    set_3d_view_background_black()
    
    # NEW: Set three-up view for comprehensive volume review
    set_three_up_view()
    
    # Continue with volume cropping...
```

#### After Cropping (`check_crop_completion`)
```python
def check_crop_completion(original_volume_node):
    # Process cropped volume...
    set_cropped_volume_visible(node)
    
    # Clean up ROI nodes...
    
    # NEW: Switch to 3D-only view after cropping
    qt.QTimer.singleShot(500, set_3d_only_view)
    
    # Continue with threshold segment...
```

## User Experience

### Before Cropping
- **Three slice views side by side** provides comprehensive visualization **without 3D distractions**
- **Red view**: Axial slices (top-down view) - **Left panel** - **Centered**
- **Green view**: Sagittal slices (side view) - **Center panel** - **Centered**
- **Yellow view**: Coronal slices (front view) - **Right panel** - **Centered**
- **3D view hidden** to focus on slice-based volume analysis
- **Field of view reset** ensures images are optimally centered using built-in Slicer functionality
- User can see volume from all angles while positioning crop ROI

### After Cropping
- **3D-only view** focuses attention on 3D visualization
- Optimized for placing lesion points and analyzing vessel structure
- Eliminates slice view distractions
- Perfect for circle placement and radius adjustments

## Technical Notes

- **Timing**: 500ms delay for 3D view switch to ensure proper rendering
- **Error Handling**: Both functions include try/catch blocks with console feedback
- **Volume Assignment**: Automatically assigns current working volume to all views
- **Field of View Reset**: Images automatically centered using built-in `resetSliceViews()` function
- **Camera Reset**: 3D view resets focal point and camera position for optimal viewing
- **Compatibility**: Uses custom layout for three-slice view, standard layout for 3D-only

## Benefits

✅ **Better Orientation**: Three slice views side by side help users understand volume anatomy before cropping
✅ **No 3D Distractions**: 3D view hidden during crop positioning for focused slice analysis
✅ **Focused Analysis**: 3D-only view eliminates slice distractions during lesion analysis  
✅ **Automatic Transitions**: No manual view switching required
✅ **Consistent Experience**: Standardized view progression through workflow
✅ **Optimal Visualization**: Each phase uses the most appropriate view configuration
