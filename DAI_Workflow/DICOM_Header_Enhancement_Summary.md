# DICOM Header Files Enhancement Summary

## Problem
The DICOM series was loading correctly, but header files (`v_headers` and `v_headers.index`) were not being included in the loading process. These files contain important metadata for proper DICOM interpretation.

## Solution
Enhanced the `load_dicom_from_source_file()` function with multiple approaches to handle header files:

### Method 2b: Enhanced DICOM Module with Header Support
- Detects presence of header files in the directory
- Uses enhanced import method that includes all files (including headers)
- Imports without copying to preserve file relationships
- Adds metadata attribute to indicate header file presence

### Method 3c: VTK DICOM Reader with Header Integration
- Identifies header files during directory scanning
- Uses primary `v_headers` file for enhanced metadata loading
- Stores header file information in volume node attributes
- Creates descriptive volume names indicating header inclusion

### Enhanced Testing Function
- `test_dicom_directory_loading()` now detects and reports header files
- Provides specific guidance when header files are found
- Shows which files will be included in the loading process

## Key Features
1. **Header File Detection**: Automatically finds `v_headers*` files in the directory
2. **Metadata Preservation**: Stores header information in the loaded volume
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Clear feedback about header file usage during loading
4. **Fallback Support**: If headers can't be loaded, falls back to standard DICOM loading

## Usage
The enhanced function will automatically detect and use header files when present:

```python
# Test the enhanced loading
test_dicom_directory_loading(r"C:\Users\croger52\Desktop\SYS_01")

# Or load directly
load_dicom_from_source_file(r"C:\Users\croger52\Desktop\SYS_01")
```

## Expected Output
When header files are detected, you should see messages like:
- "Detected header files (v_headers) - using enhanced import method"
- "Found header file: v_headers"
- "Found header file: v_headers.index"
- "Success: DICOM series with headers loaded"

The loaded volume will have attributes indicating header file inclusion and should provide more complete metadata interpretation.
